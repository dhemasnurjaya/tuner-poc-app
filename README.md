# Guitar & Bass Tuner (proof of concept)

This is a proof of concept for the Guitar & Bass Tuner.

Used libraries:
- [flutter_audio_capture](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_audio_capture)
- [pitch_detector_dart](https://pub.dev/packages/pitch_detector_dart)

note: since this is a POC, you need to allow audio access for the app manually in your phone settings.
